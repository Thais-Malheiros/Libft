# Libft

This project is about understanding the way some highly useful standard functions work, implementing and learning to use them.

Part 1 - Libc functions
To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply with the way they are defined in their man.
You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do not require any external functions:
• isalpha
• isdigit
• isalnum
• isascii
• isprint
• strlen
• memset
• bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi

In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():
• calloc
• strdup

Part 2 - Additional functions
In this second part, you must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
• ft_substr
• ft_strjoin
• ft_strtrim
• ft_split
• ft_itoa
• ft_strmapi
• ft_striteri
• ft_putchar_fd
• ft_putstr_fd
• ft_putendl_fd
• ft_putnbr_fd
